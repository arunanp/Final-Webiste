<p class = "ChangeTextFont"> <strong> Lebron James </strong> <em> Los Angeles Lakers</em> On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[199] On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers,[200] which was officially completed on July 9.[201] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent, Rich Paul, explained, "In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do."[202] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[203] </p>
